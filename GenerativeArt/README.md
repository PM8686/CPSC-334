### Standard Documentation Deliverables

In addition to the project specific deliverables lists above, you must also meet the following “standard documentation deliverables”. Throughout this course, we will ask you to document your work in order to slowly build a portfolio of your projects. Going forward, these types of standard documentation deliverables can be assumed to be required for all assignments unless specified otherwise.

***A blog post***

Using the [Portfolio F24](https://www.notion.so/Portfolio-F24-62e7adddb8634a88b5a7f07211a8c8a9?pvs=21) page, make a blog post describing your art and process. The post should give an overview of your artistic vision along with details of your technical implementation. Be sure to include how you have specialized your generative art to *any* potential space. You may also choose to include how your decisions were motivated by your creative vision for the project. In the same vein, also address any technical *issues* you encountered in your work. Particularly focus on issues that other artists may encounter when developing a generative art display for this space and what solutions you arrived at.

***A README***

On your GitHub repo add a readme that contains a short description and key information on reproducibility/installation/usage. This key information should be sufficient for a knowledgeable third party, outside the class, to replicate your design. This readme can/should be a subset of the material used in your blog post.

***A video of your art***

Include in the README a link to your video. The video should be as well produced as possible. It may be only a one-edit, one-shot production (:P), but it can still be 1) well-lit, 2) held steadily, 3) lacking giggles, unrelated persons or objects, etc. You can host the video wherever you like as long as the hosting platform supports in-browser playback (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo).
