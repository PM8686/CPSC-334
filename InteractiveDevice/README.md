## Files Involved:
- ESP32_game/ESP32_game.ino: code to upload to the ESP32
- game_laptop.py: code to run on the laptop that runs and displays the game

- Note: 
    - game/game.ino was the file that had the code with the OLED, but that broke :(
    - task1.py: solution to task 1, printing different letters based on the inputs
    - test.py: For my testing, can ignore.
